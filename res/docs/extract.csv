Method      | Z0.MemberExtractor.Extract(Z0.ApiMember)                              | Extracts encoded content that defines executable code for a located member
Method      | Z0.MemberExtractor.Extract(Z0.IApiHost)                               | Extracts encoded content for all operations defined by a host
Field       | Z0.MemberExtractParser.Zx7Cut                                         | The default length of the segment removed from the tail of the parsed byte array when the term code is Zx7
Property    | Z0.Asm.IBytePatternSet.FullPatternCount                               | The number of non-partial patterns in the set

Method      | Z0.IExtractParser.Parse(Z0.ExtractedCode,System.Int32)                | Parses a single extract
Method      | Z0.IExtractParser.Parse(Z0.ExtractedCode[])                           | Parses an extract sequence, returning a comprehensive result set that includes            outcomes of successful parse operations and any unfortunate failures
