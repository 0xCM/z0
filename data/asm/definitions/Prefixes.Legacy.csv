# Notes
-----------------------------------------------------
— BND prefix is encoded using F2H if the following conditions are true:
• CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0):EBX.MPX[bit 14] is set.
• BNDCFGU.EN and/or IA32_BNDCFGS.EN is set.
• When the F2 prefix precedes a near CALL, a near RET, a near JMP, a short Jcc, or a near Jcc instruction
- In 64-bit mode, the CS, DS, ES, and SS segment overrides are ignored.
