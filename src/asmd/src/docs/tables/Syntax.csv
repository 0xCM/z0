When there is ambiguity xmm1 indicates the first source operand using an XMM register and xmm2 the second source operand using an XMM register. Some instructions use the XMM0 register as the third source operand, indicated by <XMM0>. The use of the third XMM register operand is implicit in the instruction encoding and does not affect the ModR/M encoding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 1A     | Bits 5, 4, and 3 of ModR/M byte used as an opcode extension (refer to Section A.4, “Opcode Extensions For One-Byte And Two-byte Opcodes”).                                                                                                                                           |
| 1B     | Use the 0F0B opcode (UD2 instruction), the 0FB9H opcode (UD1 instruction), or the 0FFFH opcode (UD0 instruction) when deliberately trying to generate an invalid opcode exception (#UD).                                                                                             |
| 1C     | Some instructions use the same two-byte opcode. If the instruction has variations, or the opcode represents different instructions, the ModR/M byte will be used to differentiate the instruction. For the value of the ModR/M byte needed to decode the instruction, see Table A-6. |
| i64    | The instruction is invalid or not encodable in 64-bit mode. 40 through 4F (single-byte INC and DEC) are REX prefix combinations when in 64-bit mode (use FE/FF Grp 4 and 5 for INC and DEC).                                                                                         |
| o64    | Instruction is only available when in 64-bit mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| d64    | When in 64-bit mode, instruction defaults to 64-bit operand size and cannot encode 32-bit operand size.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| f64    | The operand size is forced to a 64-bit operand size when in 64-bit mode (prefixes that change operand size are ignored for this instruction in 64-bit mode).                                                                                                                         |
| v      | VEX form only exists. There is no legacy SSE form of the instruction. For Integer GPR instructions it means VEX prefix required.                                                                                                                                                     |
| v1     | VEX128 & SSE forms only exist (no VEX256), when can’t be inferred from the data size                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
