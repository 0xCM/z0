| Resource Directory Tables (and Resource Directory Entries) | A series of tables, one for each group of nodes in the tree. All top-level (Type) nodes are listed in the first table. Entries in this table point to second-level tables. Each second-level tree has the same Type ID but different Name IDs. Third-level trees have the same Type and Name IDs but different Language IDs. Each individual table is immediately followed by directory entries, in which each entry has a name or numeric identifier and a pointer to a data description or a table at the next lower level. |
| Resource Directory Strings                                 | Two-byte-aligned Unicode strings, which serve as string data that is pointed to by directory entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Resource Data Description                                  | An array of records, pointed to by tables, that describe the actual size and location of the resource data. These records are the leaves in the resource-description tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Resource Data                                              | Raw data of the resource section. The size and location information in the Resource Data Descriptions field delimit the individual regions of resource data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

# Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resources are indexed by a multiple-level binary-sorted tree structure. The general design can incorporate 
2**31 levels. By convention, however, Windows uses three levels:

Type Name Language
A series of resource directory tables relates all of the levels in the following way: 
Each directory table is followed by a series of directory entries that give the name or identifier (ID) 
for that level (Type, Name, or Language level) and an address of either a data description or another 
directory table. If the address points to a data description, then the data is a leaf in the tree. 
If the address points to another directory table, then that table lists directory entries at the next 
level down.

A leaf's Type, Name, and Language IDs are determined by the path that is taken through directory tables to 
reach the leaf. The first table determines Type ID, the second table (pointed to by the directory entry in 
the first table) determines Name ID, and the third table determines Language ID.
