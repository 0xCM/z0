# Description

Each data directory gives the address and size of a table or string that Windows uses. These data directory entries 
are all loaded into memory so that the system can use them at run time. A data directory is an 8-byte field 
that has the following declaration:

typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
    DWORD   VirtualAddress;
    DWORD   Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;

The first field, VirtualAddress, is actually the RVA of the table. The RVA is the address of the table relative 
to the base address of the image when the table is loaded. The second field gives the size in bytes. The data 
directories, which form the last part of the optional header, are listed in the following table.

Note that the number of directories is not fixed. Before looking for a specific directory, check the 
NumberOfRvaAndSizes field in the optional header.

Also, do not assume that the RVAs in this table point to the beginning of a section or that the sections that contain 
specific tables have specific names.
