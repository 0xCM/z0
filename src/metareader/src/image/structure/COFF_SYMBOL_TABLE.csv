| 0      | 8    | Name (*)           | The name of the symbol, represented by a union of three structures. An array of 8 bytes is used if the name is not more than 8 bytes long. For more information, see Symbol Name Representation . |
| 8      | 4    | Value              | The value that is associated with the symbol. The interpretation of this field depends on SectionNumber and StorageClass. A typical meaning is the relocatable address.                           |
| 12     | 2    | SectionNumber      | The signed integer that identifies the section, using a one-based index into the section table. Some values have special meaning, as defined in section 5.4.2, "Section Number Values."           |
| 14     | 2    | Type               | A number that represents type. Microsoft tools set this field to 0x20 (function) or 0x0 (not a function). For more information, see Type Representation .                                         |
| 16     | 1    | StorageClass       | An enumerated value that represents storage class. For more information, see Storage Class .                                                                                                      |
| 17     | 1    | NumberOfAuxSymbols | The number of auxiliary symbol table entries that follow this record.                                                                                                                             |

# Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The symbol table in this section is inherited from the traditional COFF format. It is distinct from Microsoft Visual 
C++ debug information. A file can contain both a COFF symbol table and Visual C++ debug information, 
and the two are kept separate. Some Microsoft tools use the symbol table for limited but important purposes, 
such as communicating COMDAT information to the linker. Section names and file names, as well as code and data 
symbols, are listed in the symbol table.

The location of the symbol table is indicated in the COFF header.

The symbol table is an array of records, each 18 bytes long. Each record is either a standard or auxiliary 
symbol-table record. A standard record defines a symbol or name and has the following format.
