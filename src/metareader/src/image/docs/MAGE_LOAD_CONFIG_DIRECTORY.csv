# Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The load configuration structure (IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY) was formerly used in very limited cases in the 
Windows NT operating system itself to describe various features too difficult or too large to describe in the 
file header or optional header of the image. Current versions of the Microsoft linker and Windows XP and later 
versions of Windows use a new version of this structure for 32-bit x86-based systems that include reserved SEH 
technology. This provides a list of safe structured exception handlers that the operating system uses during 
exception dispatching. If the handler address resides in an image's VA range and is marked as reserved SEH-aware 
(that is, IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_NO_SEH is clear in the DllCharacteristics field of the optional header, 
as described earlier), then the handler must be in the list of known safe handlers for that image. Otherwise, 
the operating system terminates the application. This helps prevent the "x86 exception handler hijacking" 
exploit that has been used in the past to take control of the operating system.

The Microsoft linker automatically provides a default load configuration structure to include the reserved 
SEH data. If the user code already provides a load configuration structure, it must include the new reserved
SEH fields. Otherwise, the linker cannot include the reserved SEH data and the image is not marked as containing 
reserved SEH.

The data directory entry for a pre-reserved SEH load configuration structure must specify a particular 
size of the load configuration structure because the operating system loader always expects it to be a 
certain value. In that regard, the size is really only a version check. For compatibility with Windows 
XP and earlier versions of Windows, the size must be 64 for x86 images.
