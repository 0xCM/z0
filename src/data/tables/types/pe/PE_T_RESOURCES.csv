| Data                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resource Directory Tables (and Resource Directory Entries) | A series of tables, one for each group of nodes in the tree. All top-level (Type) nodes are listed in the first table. Entries in this table point to second-level tables. Each second-level tree has the same Type ID but different Name IDs. Third-level trees have the same Type and Name IDs but different Language IDs. Each individual table is immediately followed by directory entries, in which each entry has a name or numeric identifier and a pointer to a data description or a table at the next lower level. |
| Resource Directory Strings                                 | Two-byte-aligned Unicode strings, which serve as string data that is pointed to by directory entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Resource Data Description                                  | An array of records, pointed to by tables, that describe the actual size and location of the resource data. These records are the leaves in the resource-description tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Resource Data                                              | Raw data of the resource section. The size and location information in the Resource Data Descriptions field delimit the individual regions of resource data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
