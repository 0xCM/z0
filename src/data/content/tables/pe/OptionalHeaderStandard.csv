# The first eight fields of the optional header are standard fields that are defined for every implementation of COFF. These
# fields contain general information that is useful for loading and running an executable file.

| Offset | Size | Field                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 0      | 2    | Magic                   | The unsigned integer that identifies the state of the image file. The most common number is 0x10B, which identifies it as a normal executable file. 0x107 identifies it as a ROM image, and 0x20B identifies it as a PE32+ executable.                                                                                            |

| 3      | 1    | MinorLinkerVersion      | The linker minor version number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4      | 4    | SizeOfCode              | The size of the code (text) section, or the sum of all code sections if there are multiple sections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 8      | 4    | SizeOfInitializedData   | The size of the initialized data section, or the sum of all such sections if there are multiple data sections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12     | 4    | SizeOfUninitializedData | The size of the uninitialized data section (BSS), or the sum of all such sections if there are multiple BSS sections.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 16     | 4    | AddressOfEntryPoint     | The address of the entry point relative to the image base when the executable file is loaded into memory. For program images, this is the starting address. For device drivers, this is the address of the initialization function. An entry point is optional for DLLs. When no entry point is present, this field must be zero. |
| 20     | 4    | BaseOfCode              | The address that is relative to the image base of the beginning-of-code section when it is loaded into memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
