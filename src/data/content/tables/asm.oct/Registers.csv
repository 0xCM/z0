| rXX    | Form of register identifier that indicates 16, 32 or 64-bit widths are applicable                          | rAX can indicate AX, EAX or RAX.                                                                                                                    |
| /x     | Indicates that the Rex.B bit is used to modify the register specified in the reg field of the opcode       | rCX/r9 is used to indicate that the register could either be rCX or r9                                                                              |

| *      | A register identifier of the form eXX or rXX is used when register width depends on the operand-size       |                                                                                                                                                     |

|        | are possible; rXX is used when 16, 32, or 64-bit sizes are possible. For example: eAX indicates that       |                                                                                                                                                     |
