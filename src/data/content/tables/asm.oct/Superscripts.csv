| Symbol | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1A     | Bits 5, 4, and 3 of ModR/M byte used as an opcode extension (refer to Section A.4, “Opcode Extensions For One-Byte And Two-byte Opcodes”).                                                                                                                                           |
| 1B     | Use the 0F0B opcode (UD2 instruction), the 0FB9H opcode (UD1 instruction), or the 0FFFH opcode (UD0 instruction) when deliberately trying to generate an invalid opcode exception (#UD).                                                                                             |
| 1C     | Some instructions use the same two-byte opcode. If the instruction has variations, or the opcode represents different instructions, the ModR/M byte will be used to differentiate the instruction. For the value of the ModR/M byte needed to decode the instruction, see Table A-6. |
| i64    | The instruction is invalid or not encodable in 64-bit mode. 40 through 4F (single-byte INC and DEC) are REX prefix combinations when in 64-bit mode (use FE/FF Grp 4 and 5 for INC and DEC).                                                                                         |
| o64    | Instruction is only available when in 64-bit mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| d64    | When in 64-bit mode, instruction defaults to 64-bit operand size and cannot encode 32-bit operand size.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| f64    | The operand size is forced to a 64-bit operand size when in 64-bit mode (prefixes that change operand size are ignored for this instruction in 64-bit mode).                                                                                                                         |
| v      | VEX form only exists. There is no legacy SSE form of the instruction. For Integer GPR instructions it means VEX prefix required.                                                                                                                                                     |
| v1     | VEX128 & SSE forms only exist (no VEX256), when can’t be inferred from the data size                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
