# ADC — Add with Carry

## Description

Adds the destination operand (first operand), the source operand (second operand), and the carry (CF) flag and stores the result in 
the destination operand. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; the source operand can be an immediate, a 
register, or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) The state of the CF flag represents 
a carry from a previous addition. When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the destination 
operand format.

The ADC instruction does not distinguish between signed or unsigned operands. Instead, the processor evaluates the result for both data 
types and sets the OF and CF flags to indicate a carry in the signed or unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign 
of the signed result.

The ADC instruction is usually executed as part of a multibyte or multiword addition in which an ADD instruction is followed by an 
ADC instruction.

This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to 
additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the 
beginning of this section for encoding data and limits

## Operation

DEST ← DEST + SRC + CF;
