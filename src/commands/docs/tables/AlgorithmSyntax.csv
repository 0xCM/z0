# Algorithm Identifiers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Identifier    | Meaning
| OperandSize   | The OperandSize identifier represents the operand-size attribute of the instruction (16, 32 or 64-bits)
| AddressSize   | The AddressSize identifier represents the address-size attribute (16, 32 or 64-bits)
| StackAddrSize | Represents the stack address-size attribute associated with the instruction (16, 32 or 64-bits)
|               | See “Address-Size Attribute for Stack” in Chapter 6, “Procedure Calls, Interrupts, and Exceptions,” of the 
|               | Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.
| SRC           | Represents the source operand
| DEST          | Represents the destination operand
| MAXVL         | The maximum vector register width pertaining to the instruction. This is not the vector-length encoding in the
|               | instruction's encoding but is instead determined by the current value of XCR0. Future processors may define new 
|               | bits in XCR0 whose setting may imply other values for MAXVL.
