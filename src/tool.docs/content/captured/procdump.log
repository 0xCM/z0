                [-r]

Uninstall Usage: 
   procdump.exe -u

Options:
   -mm     Write a 'Mini' dump file. (default)
           Includes the Process, Thread, Module, Handle and Address Space info.
   -ma     Write a 'Full' dump file.
           Includes All the Image, Mapped and Private memory.
   -mp     Write a 'MiniPlus' dump file.
           Includes all Private memory and all Read/Write Image or Mapped memory.
           To minimize size, the largest Private memory area over 512MB is excluded.
           A memory area is defined as the sum of same-sized memory allocations.
           The dump is as detailed as a Full dump but 10%-75% the size.
           Note: CLR processes are dumped as Full (-ma) due to debugging limitations.
   -mc     Write a 'Custom' dump file.
           Include memory defined by the specified MINIDUMP_TYPE mask (Hex).
   -md     Write a 'Callback' dump file.
           Include memory defined by the MiniDumpWriteDump callback routine
           named MiniDumpCallbackRoutine of the specified DLL.
   -mk     Also write a 'Kernel' dump file.
           Includes the kernel stacks of the threads in the process.
           OS doesn't support a kernel dump (-mk) when using a clone (-r).
           When using multiple dump sizes, a kernel dump is taken for each dump size.

   -a      Avoid outage. Requires -r. If the trigger will cause the target
           to suspend for a prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent
           dump limit, the trigger will be skipped.
   -b      Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them).
   -c      CPU threshold above which to create a dump of the process.
   -cl     CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process.
   -e      Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception.
           Include the 1 to create dump on first chance exceptions.
   -f      Filter (include) on the content of exceptions and debug logging.
           Wildcards (*) are supported.
   -fx     Filter (exclude) on the content of exceptions and debug logging.
           Wildcards (*) are supported.
   -g      Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop).
   -h      Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to
           window messages for at least 5 seconds).
   -i      Install ProcDump as the AeDebug postmortem debugger.
           Only -mm, -ma, -mp, -mc, -md and -r are supported as additional options.
           Uninstall (-u only) restores the previous configuration.
   -k      Kill the process after cloning (-r), or at end of dump collection.
   -l      Display the debug logging of the process.
   -m      Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump.
   -ml     Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value.
   -n      Number of dumps to write before exiting.
   -o      Overwrite an existing dump file.
   -p      Trigger on the specified performance counter when the threshold
           is exceeded. Note: to specify a process counter when there are
           multiple instances of the process running, use the process ID
           with the following syntax: "\Process(<name>_<pid>)\counter"
   -pl     Trigger when performance counter falls below the specified value.
   -r      Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5).
           OS doesn't support a kernel dump (-mk) when using a clone (-r).
           CAUTION: a high concurrency value may impact system performance.
           - Windows 7   : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.
           - Windows 8.0 : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.
           - Windows 8.1+: Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported.
   -s      Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).
   -t      Write a dump when the process terminates.
   -u      Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with -c).
           As the only option, Uninstalls ProcDump as the postmortem debugger.
   -w      Wait for the specified process to launch if it's not running.
   -wer    Queue the (largest) dump to Windows Error Reporting.
   -x      Launch the specified image with optional arguments. 
           If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start
           on the next activation (only).
   -64     By default ProcDump will capture a 32-bit dump of a 32-bit process
           when running on 64-bit Windows. This option overrides to create a
           64-bit dump. Only use for WOW64 subsystem debugging.

License Agreement:
   Use the -accepteula command line option to automatically accept the
   Sysinternals license agreement.

Automated Termination:
   Setting an event with the name "procdump-<PID>" is the same as typing Ctrl+C
   to gracefully terminate ProcDump.

Filename:
   Default dump filename: PROCESSNAME_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.dmp
   The following substitutions are supported:
           PROCESSNAME   Process Name
           PID           Process ID
           EXCEPTIONCODE Exception Code
           YYMMDD        Year/Month/Day
           HHMMSS        Hour/Minute/Second

Examples:
   Use -? -e to see example command lines.
