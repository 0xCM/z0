| al1055 | Referenced assembly 'filename' does not have a strong name This error is issued when you are building an assembly with a strong name and reference an assembly that does not have a strong name. To fix this, you must either regenerate your assembly with a strong name, or attach a strong name to the assembly by using Sn.exe (see the documentation for Sn.exe ). A common occurrence of this error is when you are using COM objects by way of wrapper assemblies, such as when you add a reference to a COM module to a C# project by way of the Visual Studio IDE. To avoid the error, you can specify the strong name key file for COM wrapper assemblies in the Project Property "Wrapper Assembly Key File/Name" If you are creating the wrapper assembly through tlbimp, see the tlbimp documentation for information about how to assign a strong name to the wrapper assembly. If an assembly has a strong name, it can be installed in the global assembly cache. Consequently, referenced assemblies would also go into the global assembly cache. Only assemblies with strong names can go into the global assembly cache. |

| al1075 | Delay signing was requested, but no key was given When an assembly is delay signed, the compiler does not compute and store the signature, but reserves space in the file so the signature can be added later. For example, using /delaysign+ enables a tester to put the assembly in the global cache. After testing, you can fully sign the assembly by adding the private key to the assembly by using the Assembly Linker utility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
