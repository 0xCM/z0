| -graphBuild[: True or False ]        | -graph[: True or False ]   | Causes MSBuild to construct and build a project graph. Constructing a graph involves identifying project references to form dependencies. Building that graph involves attempting to build project references prior to the projects that reference them, differing from traditional MSBuild scheduling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| -interactive[: True or False ]       | -                          | Indicates that actions in the build are allowed to interact with the user. Do not use this argument in an automated scenario where interactivity is not expected. Specifying -interactive is the same as specifying -interactive:true. Use the parameter to override a value that comes from a response file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -isolateProjects[: True or False ]   | -isolate[: True or False ] | Causes MSBuild to build each project in isolation. This is a more restrictive mode of MSBuild as it requires that the project graph be statically discoverable at evaluation time, but can improve scheduling and reduce memory overhead when building a large set of projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -maxCpuCount[: number ]              | -m[: number ]              | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building. If you don't include this switch, the default value is 1. If you include this switch without specifying a value, MSBuild will use up to the number of processors in the computer. For more information, see Building multiple projects in parallel . The following example instructs MSBuild to build using three MSBuild processes, which allows three projects to build at the same time: msbuild myproject.proj -maxcpucount:3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| -nodeReuse: value                    | -nr: value                 | Enable or disable the re-use of MSBuild nodes. You can specify the following values: - True . Nodes remain after the build finishes so that subsequent builds can use them (default). - False . Nodes don't remain after the build completes. A node corresponds to a project that's executing. If you include the -maxcpucount switch, multiple nodes can execute concurrently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| -preprocess[: filepath ]             | -pp[: filepath ]           | Create a single, aggregated project file by inlining all the files that would be imported during a build, with their boundaries marked. You can use this switch to more easily determine which files are being imported, from where the files are being imported, and which files contribute to the build. When you use this switch, the project isn't built. If you specify a filepath , the aggregated project file is output to the file. Otherwise, the output appears in the console window.

For more information, see Overriding ToolsVersion settings . For MSBuild 4.5, you can specify the following values for version : 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0. If you specify 4.0, the VisualStudioVersion build property specifies which sub-toolset to use. For more information, see the Sub-toolsets section of Toolset (ToolsVersion) . A Toolset consists of tasks, targets, and tools that are used to build an application. The tools include compilers such as csc.exe and vbc.exe . For more information about Toolsets, see Toolset (ToolsVersion) , Standard and custom toolset configurations , and Multitargeting . Note: The toolset version isn't the same as the target framework, which is the version of the .NET Framework on which a project is built to run.

| -warnAsError[: code [ ;code2 ]       | -err[ :code [ ;code2 ]     | List of warning codes to treats as errors. Use a semicolon or a comma to separate multiple warning codes. To treat all warnings as errors, use the switch with no values. When a warning is treated as an error the target continues to execute as if it was a warning but the overall build fails.
