| MSBuildBinPath                 | The absolute path of the folder where the MSBuild binaries that are currently being used are located (for example, C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\<versionNumber> ). This property is useful if you have to refer to files in the MSBuild directory. Do not include the final backslash on this property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\MSBuild\Current\Bin |
| MSBuildExtensionsPath          | Introduced in the .NET Framework 4: there is no difference between the default values of MSBuildExtensionsPath and MSBuildExtensionsPath32 . You can set the environment variable MSBUILDLEGACYEXTENSIONSPATH to a non-null value to enable the behavior of the default value of MSBuildExtensionsPath in earlier versions. In the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier, the default value of MSBuildExtensionsPath points to the path of the MSBuild subfolder under the \Program Files\ or \Program Files (x86) folder, depending on the bitness of the current process. For example, for a 32-bit process on a 64-bit machine, this property points to the \Program Files (x86) folder. For a 64-bit process on a 64-bit machine, this property points to the \Program Files folder. Do not include the final backslash on this property. This location is a useful place to put custom target files. For example, your target files could be installed at \Program Files\MSBuild\MyFiles\Northwind.targets and then imported in project files by using this XML code: <Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\MyFiles\Northwind.targets"/> | C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\MSBuild             |
| MSBuildExtensionsPath32        | The path of the MSBuild subfolder under the \Program Files or \Program Files (x86) folder. The path always points to the 32-bit \Program Files (x86) folder on a 32-bit machine and \Program Files on a 64-bit machine.". See also MSBuildExtensionsPath and MSBuildExtensionsPath64 . Do not include the final backslash on this property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\MSBuild             |
| MSBuildExtensionsPath64        | The path of the MSBuild subfolder under the \Program Files folder. For a 64-bit machine, this path always points to the \Program Files folder. For a 32-bit machine, this path is blank. See also MSBuildExtensionsPath and MSBuildExtensionsPath32 .

| MSBuildLastTaskResult          | true if the previous task completed without any errors (even if there were warnings), or false if the previous task had errors. Typically, when an error occurs in a task, the error is the last thing that happens in that project. Therefore, the value of this property is never false , except in these scenarios: - When the ContinueOnError attribute of the Task element (MSBuild) is set to WarnAndContinue (or true ) or ErrorAndContinue . - When the Target has an OnError element (MSBuild) as a child element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | true                                                                            |
| MSBuildNodeCount               | The maximum number of concurrent processes that are used when building. This is the value that you specified for -maxcpucount on the command line. If you specified -maxcpucount without specifying a value, then MSBuildNodeCount specifies the number of processors in the computer.
