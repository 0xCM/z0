| NE         | N.E.   | Indicates an instruction syntax is not encodable in 64-bit mode (it may represent part of a sequence of valid instructions in other modes).                                                                   |
| NP         | N.P.   | Indicates the REX prefix does not affect the legacy instruction in 64-bit mode.                                                                                                                               |
| NI         | N.I.   | Indicates the opcode is treated as a new instruction in 64-bit mode.                                                                                                                                          |
| NS         | N.S.   | Indicates an instruction syntax that requires an address override prefix in 64-bit mode and is not supported. Using an address override prefix in 64-bit mode may result in model-specific execution behavior |
