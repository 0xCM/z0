LEA Operation with Address and Operand Size Attributes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Operand Size | Address Size | Mode | Action Performed                                                                                                                     |
| 16           | 16           | Legacy | 16-bit effective address is calculated and stored in requested 16-bit register destination.                                          |
| 16           | 32           | Legacy | 32-bit effective address is calculated. The lower 16 bits of the address are stored in the requested 16-bit register destination.    |
| 32           | 16           | Legacy | 16-bit effective address is calculated. The 16-bit address is zero-extended and stored in the requested 32-bit register destination. |
| 32           | 32           | Legacy | 32-bit effective address is calculated and stored in the requested 32-bit register destination.                                      |
| 16           | 32           | 64  | 32-bit effective address is calculated (using 67H prefix). The lower 16 bits of the address are stored in the requested 16-bit register destination (using 66H prefix).     |
| 16           | 64           | 64  | 64-bit effective address is calculated (default address size). The lower 16 bits of the address are stored in the requested 16-bit register destination (using 66H prefix). |
| 32           | 32           | 64  | 32-bit effective address is calculated (using 67H prefix) and stored in the requested 32-bit register destination.                                                          |
| 32           | 64           | 64  | 64-bit effective address is calculated (default address size) and the lower 32 bits of the address are stored in the requested 32-bit register destination.                 |
| 64           | 32           | 64  | 32-bit effective address is calculated (using 67H prefix), zero-extended to 64-bits, and stored in the requested 64-bit register destination (using REX.W).                 |
| 64           | 64           | 64  | 64-bit effective address is calculated (default address size) and all 64-bits of the address are stored in the requested 64-bit register destination (using REX.W).         |
