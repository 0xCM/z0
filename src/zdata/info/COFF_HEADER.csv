# COFF_HEADER
# Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every image file has an optional header that provides information to the loader. This header is optional in the 
sense that some files (specifically, object files) do not have it. For image files, this header is required. 
An object file can have an optional header, but generally this header has no function in an object file except 
to increase its size.

Note that the size of the optional header is not fixed. The SizeOfOptionalHeader field in the COFF header must 
be used to validate that a probe into the file for a particular data directory does not go beyond 
SizeOfOptionalHeader. For more information, see COFF File Header (Object and Image).

The NumberOfRvaAndSizes field of the optional header should also be used to ensure that no probe for a 
particular data directory entry goes beyond the optional header. In addition, it is important to validate the 
optional header magic number for format compatibility.

The optional header magic number determines whether an image is a PE32 or PE32+ executable.
The first eight fields of the optional header are standard fields that are defined for every implementation 
of COFF. These fields contain general information that is useful for loading and running an executable file. 
They are unchanged for the PE32+ format.
