# IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY
# Description
The directory entries make up the rows of a table. Each resource directory entry has the following format. 
Whether the entry is a Name or ID entry is indicated by the resource directory table, which indicates how 
many Name and ID entries follow it (remember that all the Name entries precede all the ID entries for the table). 
All entries for the table are sorted in ascending order: the Name entries by case-sensitive string and the 
ID entries by numeric value. Offsets are relative to the address in the IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE 
DataDirectory. See Peering Inside the PE: A Tour of the Win32 Portable Executable File Format for more information.
