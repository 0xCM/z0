# IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER
# Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each row of the section table is, in effect, a section header. This table immediately follows 
the optional header, if any. This positioning is required because the file header does not 
contain a direct pointer to the section table. Instead, the location of the section table is determined 
by calculating the location of the first byte after the headers. Make sure to use the size of the optional
 header as specified in the file header.

The number of entries in the section table is given by the NumberOfSections field in the file header. 
Entries in the section table are numbered starting from one (1). The code and data memory section entries are 
in the order chosen by the linker.

In an image file, the VAs for sections must be assigned by the linker so that they are in ascending order and 
adjacent, and they must be a multiple of the SectionAlignment value in the optional header.

Each section header (section table entry) has the following format, for a total of 40 bytes per entry.
