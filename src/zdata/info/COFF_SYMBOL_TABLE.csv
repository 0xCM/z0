# COFF_SYMBOL_TABLE
# Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The symbol table in this section is inherited from the traditional COFF format. It is distinct from Microsoft Visual 
C++ debug information. A file can contain both a COFF symbol table and Visual C++ debug information, 
and the two are kept separate. Some Microsoft tools use the symbol table for limited but important purposes, 
such as communicating COMDAT information to the linker. Section names and file names, as well as code and data 
symbols, are listed in the symbol table.

The location of the symbol table is indicated in the COFF header.

The symbol table is an array of records, each 18 bytes long. Each record is either a standard or auxiliary 
symbol-table record. A standard record defines a symbol or name and has the following format.
