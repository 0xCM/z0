| Offset (PE32/ PE32+) | Size (PE32/ PE32+) | Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 0                    | 4/8                | Raw Data Start VA    | The starting address of the TLS template. The template is a block of data that is used to initialize TLS data. The system copies all of this data each time a thread is created, so it must not be corrupted. Note that this address is not an RVA; it is an address for which there should be a base relocation in the .reloc section. |
| 4/8                  | 4/8                | Raw Data End VA      | The address of the last byte of the TLS, except for the zero fill. As with the Raw Data Start VA field, this is a VA, not an RVA.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8/16                 | 4/8                | Address of Index     | The location to receive the TLS index, which the loader assigns. This location is in an ordinary data section, so it can be given a symbolic name that is accessible to the program.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 12/24                | 4/8                | Address of Callbacks | The pointer to an array of TLS callback functions. The array is null-terminated, so if no callback function is supported, this field points to 4Â bytes set to zero. For information about the prototype for these functions, see TLS Callback Functions .                                                                               |
| 16/32                | 4                  | Size of Zero Fill    | The size in bytes of the template, beyond the initialized data delimited by the Raw Data Start VA and Raw Data End VA fields. The total template size should be the same as the total size of TLS data in the image file. The zero fill is the amount of data that comes after the initialized nonzero data.                            |
| 20/36                | 4                  | Characteristics      | The four bits [23:20] describe alignment info. Possible values are those defined as IMAGE_SCN_ALIGN_*, which are also used to describe alignment of section in object files. The other 28 bits are reserved for future use.                                                                                                             |
