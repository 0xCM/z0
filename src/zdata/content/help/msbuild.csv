| MSBuildExtensionsPath          | Well-known             | Introduced in the .NET Framework 4: there is no difference between the default values of MSBuildExtensionsPath and MSBuildExtensionsPath32 . You can set the environment variable MSBUILDLEGACYEXTENSIONSPATH to a non-null value to enable the behavior of the default value of MSBuildExtensionsPath in earlier versions. In the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier, the default value of MSBuildExtensionsPath points to the path of the MSBuild subfolder under the \Program Files\ or \Program Files (x86) folder, depending on the bitness of the current process. For example, for a 32-bit process on a 64-bit machine, this property points to the \Program Files (x86) folder. For a 64-bit process on a 64-bit machine, this property points to the \Program Files folder. Do not include the final backslash on this property. This location is a useful place to put custom target files. For example, your target files could be installed at \Program Files\MSBuild\MyFiles\Northwind.targets and then imported in project files by using this XML code: <Import Project="$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\MyFiles\Northwind.targets"/> | C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\MSBuild             |
| MSBuildExtensionsPath32        | Well-known             | The path of the MSBuild subfolder under the \Program Files or \Program Files (x86) folder. The path always points to the 32-bit \Program Files (x86) folder on a 32-bit machine and \Program Files on a 64-bit machine.". See also MSBuildExtensionsPath and MSBuildExtensionsPath64 .

| DisableFastUpToDateCheck           | All          | A boolean value that applies to Visual Studio only. The Visual Studio build manager uses a process called FastUpToDateCheck to determine whether a project must be rebuilt to be up to date. This process is faster than using MSBuild to determine this. Setting the DisableFastUpToDateCheck property to true lets you bypass the Visual Studio build manager and force it to use MSBuild to determine whether the project is up to date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| ExcludeDeploymentUrl               | .NET         | The GenerateDeploymentManifest task adds a deploymentProvider tag to the deployment manifest if the project file includes any of the following elements: - UpdateUrl - InstallUrl - PublishUrl Using ExcludeDeploymentUrl, however, you can prevent the deploymentProvider tag from being added to the deployment manifest even if any of the above URLs are specified. To do this, add the following property to your project file: <ExcludeDeploymentUrl>true</ExcludeDeploymentUrl> Note: ExcludeDeploymentUrl is not exposed in the Visual Studio IDE and can be set only by manually editing the project file. Setting this property does not affect publishing within Visual Studio; that is, the deploymentProvider tag will still be added to the URL specified by PublishUrl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| NoWin32Manifest                    | .NET         | A boolean value that indicates whether User Account Control (UAC) manifest information will be embedded in the application's executable. Applies only to Visual Studio projects targeting Windows Vista. In projects deployed using ClickOnce and Registration-Free COM, this element is ignored. False (the default value) specifies that User Account Control (UAC) manifest information be embedded in the application's executable. True specifies that UAC manifest information not be embedded. This property applies only to Visual Studio projects targeting Windows Vista. In projects deployed using ClickOnce and Registration-Free COM, this property is ignored. You should add NoWin32Manifest only if you do not want Visual Studio to embed any manifest information in the application's executable; this process is called virtualization . To use virtualization, set <ApplicationManifest> in conjunction with <NoWin32Manifest> as follows: - For Visual Basic projects, remove the <ApplicationManifest> node. (In Visual Basic projects, <NoWin32Manifest> is ignored when an <ApplicationManifest> node exists.) - For C# projects, set <ApplicationManifest> to False and <NoWin32Manifest> to True . (In C# projects, <ApplicationManifest> overrides <NoWin32Manifest> .) This property is equivalent to the /nowin32manifest compiler switch of vbc.exe . |

| VisualStudioVersion                | All          | Specifies the version of Visual Studio under which this project should be considered to be running. If this property isn't specified, MSBuild sets it to a reasonable default value. This property is used in several project types to specify the set of targets that are used for the build. If ToolsVersion is set to 4.0 or higher for a project, VisualStudioVersion is used to specify which sub-toolset to use.
