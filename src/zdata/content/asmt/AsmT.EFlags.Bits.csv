| Id | Bit | Name          | Description                                                                                                              |
| CF | 0   | Carry Flag    | Set if an arithmetic operation generates a carry or a borrow out of the most-significant bit of the result;              |
|    |     |               | cleared otherwise. This flag indicates an overflow condition for unsigned-integer arithmetic. It is also used            |
|    |     |               | in multiple-precision arithmetic.                                                                                        |
| PF | 2   | Parity Flag   | Set if the least-significant byte of the result contains an even number of 1 bits; cleared otherwise.                    |
| AF | 4   | Adjust Flag   | Set if an arithmetic operation generates a carry or a borrow out of bit 3 of the result; cleared otherwise.              |
|    |     |               | This flag is used in binarycoded decimal (BCD) arithmetic.                                                               |
| ZF | 6   | Zero Flag     | Set if the result is zero; cleared otherwise                                                                             |
| SF | 7   | Sign Flag     | Set equal to the most-significant bit of the result, which is the sign bit of a signed integer.                          |
|    |     |               | (0 indicates a positive value and 1 indicates a negative value.)                                                         |
| OF | 11  | Overflow Flag | Set if the integer result is too large a positive number or too small a negative number                                  |
|    |     |               | (excluding the sign-bit) to fit in the destination operand; cleared otherwise. This flag indicates an overflow condition |
|    |     |               | for signed-integer (twoâ€™s complement) arithmetic                                                                         |
