| Name                             | Description                                                                                                        |
| ZeroExtend(value)                | Returns a value zero-extended to the operand-size attribute of the instruction. For                                |
|                                  | example, if the operand-size attribute is 32, zero extending a byte value of –10 converts the byte from F6H to     |
|                                  | a doubleword value of 000000F6H. If the value passed to the ZeroExtend function and the operand-size               |
|                                  | attribute are the same size, ZeroExtend returns the value unaltered.                                               |
| SignExtend(value)                | Returns a value sign-extended to the operand-size attribute of the instruction. For                                |
|                                  | example, if the operand-size attribute is 32, sign extending a byte containing the value –10 converts the byte     |
|                                  | from F6H to a doubleword value of FFFFFFF6H. If the value passed to the SignExtend function and the operand-       |
|                                  | size attribute are the same size, SignExtend returns the value unaltered.                                          |

|                                  | attribute of the instruction. See the “Operation” subsection of the “PUSH—Push Word, Doubleword or                 |
|                                  | Quadword Onto the Stack” section in Chapter 4 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s        |
|                                  | Manual, Volume 2B.                                                                                                 |
| Pop()                            | removes the value from the top of the stack and returns it. The statement EAX ← Pop(); assigns to                  |
|                                  | EAX the 32-bit value from the top of the stack. Pop will return either a word, a doubleword or a quadword          |
|                                  | depending on the operand-size attribute. See the “Operation” subsection in the “POP—Pop a Value from the           |
|                                  | Stack” section of Chapter 4 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B.       |
| PopRegisterStack                 | Marks the FPU ST(0) register as empty and increments the FPU register stack pointer                                |

| Switch-Tasks                     | Performs a task switch.                                                                                            |
| Bit(BitBase, BitOffset)          | Returns the value of a bit within a bit string. The bit string is a sequence of bits in                            |
|                                  | memory or a register. Bits are numbered from low-order to high-order within registers and within memory            |
|                                  | bytes. If the BitBase is a register, the BitOffset can be in the range 0 to [15, 31, 63] depending on the mode     |
|                                  | and register size. Bit[RAX, 21] function example:
|                                  | [63                         31          21              0]
|                                  |                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
|                                  | If BitBase is a memory address, the BitOffset has different ranges depending on the operand size, see #3.2
|                                  | The addressed bit is numbered (Offset MOD 8) within the byte at address (BitBase + (BitOffset DIV 8)) where DIV is 
|                                  | signed division with rounding towards negative infinity and MOD returns a positive number
