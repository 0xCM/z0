| Microsoft.Windows.Themes Namespace                             | Provides exposure to the set of themes defined by Windows Presentation Foundation.

| System.Collections Namespace                                   | The System.Collections namespace contains interfaces and classes that define various collections of objects, such as lists, queues, bit arrays, hash tables and dictionaries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| System.Collections.Concurrent Namespace                        | The System.Collections.Concurrent namespace provides several thread-safe collection classes that should be used in place of the corresponding types in the System.Collections and System.Collections.Generic namespaces whenever multiple threads are accessing the collection concurrently. However, access to elements of a collection object through extension methods or through explicit interface implementations are not guaranteed to be thread-safe and may need to be synchronized by the caller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| System.ComponentModel.Design Namespace                         | The System.ComponentModel.Design namespace contains classes that developers can use to build custom design-time behavior for components and user interfaces for configuring components at design time. The design time environment provides systems that enable developers to arrange components and configure their properties. Some components may require specific design-time only behavior to function properly in a design time environment. It may also be valuable to provide custom user interfaces which assist developers in configuring components or the values of complex data types. The classes and interfaces defined within this namespace can be used to build design-time behavior for components, access design-time services, and implement customized design-time configuration interfaces.                                                                                                                         |

| System.IO.IsolatedStorage Namespace                            | The System.IO.IsolatedStorage namespace contains types that allow the creation and use of isolated stores. With these stores, you can read and write data that less trusted code cannot access and prevent the exposure of sensitive information that can be saved elsewhere on the file system. Data is stored in compartments that are isolated by the current user and by the assembly in which the code exists. Additionally, data can be isolated by domain. Roaming profiles can be used in conjunction with isolated storage so isolated stores will travel with the user's profile. The IsolatedStorageScope enumeration indicates different types of isolation. For more information about when to use isolated storage, see Isolated Storage.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| System.Net Namespace                                           | The System.Net namespace provides a simple programming interface for many of the protocols used on networks today. The WebRequest and WebResponse classes form the basis of what are called pluggable protocols, an implementation of network services that enables you to develop applications that use Internet resources without worrying about the specific details of the individual protocols. Classes in the System.Net namespace can be used to develop Windows Store apps or desktop apps. When used in a Windows Store app, classes in the System.Net namespace are affected by network isolation feature, part of the application security model used by the Windows Developer Preview. The appropriate network capabilities must be enabled in the app manifest for a Windows Store app for the system to allow network access by a Windows Store app. For more information, see the Network Isolation for Windows Store Apps. |

The primary clients of these classes are script engines and compilers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Deserialization is the process of taking in stored information and recreating objects from it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Services are long-running executables that run without a user interface. Implementing a service involves inheriting from the ServiceBase class and defining specific behavior to process when start, stop, pause, and continue commands are passed in, as well as custom behavior and actions to take when the system shuts down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
