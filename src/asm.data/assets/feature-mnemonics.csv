| PBE          | PBE          | pbe         | Pending Break Enable. The processor supports the use of the FERR#/PBE# pin when the processor is in the stop-clock state (STPCLK# is asserted) to signal the processor that an interrupt is pending and that the processor should return to normal operation to handle the interrupt. Bit 10 (PBE enable) in the IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR enables this capability.                                                                            |
