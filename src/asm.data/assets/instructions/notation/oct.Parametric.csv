| Identifier    | Sort        | Symbol      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sti         | Instruction | ST(i)       | The i th element from the top of the FPU register stack (i ← 0 through 7).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Vm32ᐸxㆍyㆍzᐳ | Instruction | vm32{x,y,z} | A vector array of memory operands specified using VSIB memory addressing. The array of memory addresses are specified using a common base register, a constant scale factor, and a vector index register with individual elements of 32-bit index value in an XMM register (vm32x), a YMM register (vm32y) or a ZMM register (vm32z).                           |
| Vm64ᐸxㆍyㆍzᐳ | Instruction | vm64{x,y,z} | A vector array of memory operands specified using VSIB memory addressing. The array of memory addresses are specified using a common base register, a constant scale factor, and a vector index register with individual elements of 64-bit index value in an XMM register (vm64x), a YMM register (vm64y) or a ZMM register (vm64z).                           |
| Mask<k1ᐳ      | Instruction | {k1}        | A mask register used as instruction writemask for instructions that do not allow zeroing-masking but support merging-masking. This corresponds to instructions that require the value of the aaa field to be different than 0 (e.g., gather) and store-type instructions which allow only merging-masking.                                                      |
| Maskᐸk1ㆍzᐳ   | Instruction | {k1}{z}     | A mask register used as instruction writemask. The 64-bit k registers are: k1 through k7. Writemask specification is available exclusively via EVEX prefix. The masking can either be done as a merging masking, where the old values are preserved for masked out elements or as a zeroing masking. The type of masking is determined by using the EVEX.z bit. |
