## Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TPAUSE instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent optimized state. There are two such opti-
mized states to choose from: light-weight power/performance optimized state, and improved power/performance
optimized state. The selection between the two is governed by the explicit input register bit[0] source operand.
TPAUSE is available when CPUID.7.0:ECX.WAITPKG[bit 5] is enumerated as 1. TPAUSE may be executed at any
privilege level. This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and in 64-bit mode.
Unlike PAUSE, the TPAUSE instruction will not cause an abort when used inside a transactional region, described in
the chapter Chapter 16, “Programming with Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions,” of the Intel® 64
and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.
The input register contains information such as the preferred optimized state the processor should enter as
described in the following table. Bits other than bit 0 are reserved and will result in #GP if non-zero.
