| OperandSize       | The OperandSize identifier represents the operand-size attribute of the instruction (16, 32 or 64-bits)                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AddressSize       | The AddressSize identifier represents the address-size attribute (16, 32 or 64-bits)                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| StackAddrSize     | Represents the stack address-size attribute associated with the instruction (16, 32 or 64-bits) See “Address-Size Attribute for Stack” in Chapter 6, “Procedure Calls, Interrupts, and Exceptions,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.          |
| SRC               | Represents the source operand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| DEST              | Represents the destination operand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| MAXVL             | The maximum vector register width pertaining to the instruction. This is not the vector-length encoding in the instruction's encoding but is instead determined by the current value of XCR0. Future processors may define new  bits in XCR0 whose setting may imply other values for MAXVL. |
