Blend  [solutionfile | projectfile | folder | anyfile.ext]  [switches]

The first argument for Blend is usually a solution file, project file or a folder.
You can also use any other file as the first argument if you want to have the
file open automatically in an editor. When you enter a project file, the IDE
looks for an .sln file with the same base name as the project file in the
parent directory for the project file. If no such .sln file exists, then the
IDE looks for a single .sln file that references the project. If no such single
.sln file exists, then the IDE creates an unsaved solution with a default .sln
file name that has the same base name as the project file.


Available command line switches:

/Log	Logs IDE activity to the specified file for troubleshooting.
/ResetSettings	Restores the IDE's default settings, optionally resets to
	the specified VSSettings file.
/SafeMode	Launches the IDE in safe mode loading minimal windows.

Product-specific switches:

/debugexe	Open the specified executable to be debugged. The remainder of
	the command line is passed to this executable as its arguments.
/diff	Compares two files.  Takes four parameters:
	SourceFile, TargetFile, SourceDisplayName(optional),
	TargetDisplayName(optional)
/TfsLink	Opens Team Explorer and launches a viewer for the
	provided artifact URI if one is registered.
/useenv	Use PATH, INCLUDE, LIBPATH, and LIB environment variables
	instead of IDE paths for VC++ builds.

To attach the debugger from the command line, use:
	VsJITDebugger.exe -p <pid>
