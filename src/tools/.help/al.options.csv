| /algid: id                                             | Specifies an algorithm to hash all files in a multifile assembly except the file that contains the assembly manifest. The default algorithm is CALG_SHA1. See ALG_ID in the Platform SDK documentation for other algorithms. For the first release of the .NET Framework, only CALG_SHA1 and CALG_MD5 are valid. The hash values are stored in the file table of the assembly manifest. At installation and load time, the assembly's files are checked against their hashes. You can also specify this option as a custom attribute ( AssemblyAlgorithmIdAttribute ) in the source code for any module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                        |
| /base[address]: addr                                   | Specifies the address at which a DLL will be loaded on the user's computer at run time.

| /delay[sign][+&#124;-]                                 | Specifies whether the assembly will be fully or partially signed. Use /delaysign- if you want a fully signed assembly. Use /delaysign+ if you only want to include the public key in the assembly. When you request a fully signed assembly, Al.exe hashes the file that contains the manifest (assembly metadata) and signs that hash with the private key. The resulting digital signature is stored in the file that contains the manifest. When an assembly is delay signed, Al.exe does not compute and store the signature, but just reserves space in the file so the signature can be added later. The default is /delaysign- . The /delaysign option has no effect unless used with /keyfile or /keyname . For example, using /delaysign+ enables a tester to put the assembly in the global cache. After testing, you can fully sign the assembly by including the private key in the assembly. Note: Before using the Gacutil.exe (Global Assembly Cache Tool) to put a delay-signed assembly into the global cache, use the Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool) to register the assembly for verification skipping. For example, Sn.exe –Vr delaySignedAssembly . Use this only for development. You can also specify this option as a custom attribute ( AssemblyDelaySignAttribute ) in the source code for any MSIL module.                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                        |

If text is an empty string, the Win32 Comments resource appears as a single space. If you specify /win32res , /description will not affect the Win32 resource information.

| /keyf[ile]: filename                                   | Specifies a file ( filename ) that contains a key pair or just a public key to sign an assembly. The compiler inserts the public key in the assembly manifest and then signs the final assembly with the private key. See the Strong Name Tool ( Sn.exe ) for information about generating key files and installing key pairs into key containers. If you are using delayed signing, this file will usually have the public key but not the private key. The public key (of the key pair) information appears in the .publickey field of the assembly. You can also specify this option as a custom attribute ( AssemblyKeyFileAttribute ) in the source code for any MSIL module. If both /keyfile and /keyname are specified (either by command-line option or by custom attribute) in the same compilation, Al.exe will first try the container specified with /keyname . If that succeeds, the assembly is signed with the information in the key container. If Al.exe does not find the key container, it will try the file specified with /keyfile . If that succeeds, the assembly is signed with the information in the key file and the key information will be installed in the key container (similar to the -i option in Sn.exe ) so that on the next compilation, the /keyname option will be valid.                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                        |
| /keyn[ame]: text                                       | Specifies a container that holds a key pair. This will sign the assembly (give it a strong name) by inserting a public key into the assembly manifest. Al.exe will then sign the final assembly with the private key. Use Sn.exe to generate a key pair. The key information appears in the .publickey field of the assembly. Place text in double quotation marks (" ") if there is an embedded space. You can also specify this option as a custom attribute ( AssemblyKeyNameAttribute ) in the source code for any MSIL module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                        |

If you do not specify /productversion , the Win32 Product Version resource will be populated by the Win32 File Version resource. If you specify /win32res , /productversion will not affect the Win32 resource information.

| /v[ersion]: version                                    | Specifies version information for this assembly. The format of the version string is major . minor . build . revision . The default value is 0. If you do specify /version , you must specify major . If you specify major and minor , you can specify an asterisk (*)for build . This causes build to be equal to the number of days since January 1, 2000, local time, and revision to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight of the current day, local time, divided by 2. If you specify major , minor , and build , you can specify an asterisk for revision . This causes revision to be equal to the number of seconds since midnight of the current day, local time, divided by 2. To summarize, the valid version strings are as follows: X X.X X.X.* X.X.X X.X.X.* X.X.X.X where X is any unsigned short constant except 65535 (0-65534). If you do not specify /win32res , /version will be used as the Win32 Assembly Version resource. If you do not specify /win32res , /productversion , and /fileversion , /version will be used for the Assembly Version , File Version, and Product Version Win32 resources. If you specify /win32res , /version will not affect the Win32 resource information. You can also specify this option as a custom attribute ( AssemblyVersionAttribute ) in the source code for any MSIL module.                                               |                                                                                                                                                                        |
