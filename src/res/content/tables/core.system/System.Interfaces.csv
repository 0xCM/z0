| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| IAsync Disposable | Provides a mechanism for releasing unmanaged resources asynchronously.                                                                                           |
| IAsync Result     | Represents the status of an asynchronous operation.                                                                                                              |
| ICloneable        | Supports cloning, which creates a new instance of a class with the same value as an existing instance.                                                           |
| IComparable       | Defines a generalized type-specific comparison method that a value type or class implements to order or sort its instances.                                      |
| IComparable<T>    | Defines a generalized comparison method that a value type or class implements to create a type-specific comparison method for ordering or sorting its instances. |
| IConvertible      | Defines methods that convert the value of the implementing reference or value type to a common language runtime type that has an equivalent value.               |
| ICustom Formatter | Defines a method that supports custom formatting of the value of an object.                                                                                      |
| IDisposable       | Provides a mechanism for releasing unmanaged resources.                                                                                                          |
| IEquatable<T>     | Defines a generalized method that a value type or class implements to create a type-specific method for determining equality of instances.                       |
| IFormat Provider  | Provides a mechanism for retrieving an object to control formatting.                                                                                             |
| IFormattable      | Provides functionality to format the value of an object into a string representation.                                                                            |
| IObservable<T>    | Defines a provider for push-based notification.                                                                                                                  |
| IObserver<T>      | Provides a mechanism for receiving push-based notifications.                                                                                                     |
| IProgress<T>      | Defines a provider for progress updates.                                                                                                                         |
| IService Provider | Defines a mechanism for retrieving a service object; that is, an object that provides custom support to other objects.                                           |
