| C7 F8  | XBEGIN rel16 | A     | V/V                   | RTM                | Specifies the start of an RTM region. Provides a 16-bit relative offset to compute the address of the fallback instruction address at which execution resumes following an RTM abort. |
| C7 F8  | XBEGIN rel32 | A     | V/V                   | RTM                | Specifies the start of an RTM region. Provides a 32-bit relative offset to compute the address of the fallback instruction address at which execution resumes following an RTM abort. |
