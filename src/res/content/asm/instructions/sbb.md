## Description

Adds the source operand (second operand) and the carry (CF) flag, and subtracts the result from the destination operand (first operand). The result of the subtraction is stored in the destination operand. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; the source operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) The state of the CF flag represents a borrow from a previous subtraction.

When an immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to the length of the destination operand format.

The SBB instruction does not distinguish between signed or unsigned operands. Instead, the processor evaluates the result for both data types and sets the OF and CF flags to indicate a borrow in the signed or unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the signed result.

The SBB instruction is usually executed as part of a multibyte or multiword subtraction in which a SUB instruction is followed by a SBB instruction.

This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.

In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.

## Operation

DEST ← (DEST – (SRC + CF));

## Flags

The OF, SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF flags are set according to the result.
