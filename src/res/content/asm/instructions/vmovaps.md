# MOVAPS â€” Move Aligned Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Value

## Description

Moves 4, 8 or 16 single-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load an XMM, YMM or ZMM register from an 128-bit, 256-bit or 512-bit memory location, to store the contents of an XMM, YMM or ZMM register into a 128-bit, 256-bit or 512-bit memory location, or to move data between two XMM, two YMM or two ZMM registers.

When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte (128-bit version), 32-byte (VEX.256 encoded version) or 64-byte (EVEX.512 encoded version) boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated. For EVEX.512 encoded versions, the operand must be aligned to the size of the memory operand. To move single-precision floating-point values to and from unaligned memory locations, use the VMOVUPS instruction.

Note: VEX.vvvv and EVEX.vvvv are reserved and must be 1111b otherwise instructions will #UD.

EVEX.512 encoded version:

Moves 512 bits of packed single-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load a ZMM register from a 512-bit float32 memory location, to store the contents of a ZMM register into a float32 memory location, or to move data between two ZMM registers. When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 64-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated. To move single-precision floating-point values to and from unaligned memory locations, use the VMOVUPS instruction.

VEX.256 and EVEX.256 encoded version:

Moves 256 bits of packed single-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load a YMM register from a 256-bit memory location, to store the contents of a YMM register into a 256-bit memory location, or to move data between two YMM registers. When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 32-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated.

128-bit versions:

Moves 128 bits of packed single-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load an XMM register from a 128-bit memory location, to store the contents of an XMM register into a 128-bit memory location, or to move data between two XMM registers. When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated. To move single-precision floating-point values to and from unaligned memory locations, use the VMOVUPS instruction.

128-bit Legacy SSE version: Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the corresponding ZMM destination register remain unchanged.

(E)VEX.128 encoded version: Bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the destination ZMM register are zeroed.
